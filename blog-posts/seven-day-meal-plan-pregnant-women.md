### Why Focus on a 7-Day Meal Plan?

**Why a 7-day meal plan for pregnant women?** A structured meal plan takes away the daily stress of thinking about what to eat. This 7-day plan offers balanced meals rich in the nutrients that are most important during the first trimester, like folate, calcium, and iron. Trust us, your body will thank you for it!

### Day 1: Start Your Journey to Healthy Eating

#### Breakfast: Oatmeal with Fresh Berries
Start your day with a simple yet nutritious bowl of oatmeal, topped with fresh berries. Oats are high in fiber, which helps with digestion—a common issue during pregnancy.

#### Lunch: Quinoa Salad with Avocado
Quinoa is packed with protein, and adding avocado provides healthy fats that are important for brain development.

#### Dinner: Baked Salmon with Steamed Veggies
Salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which support your baby’s brain and eye development. Steamed veggies like broccoli and carrots round out this meal.

### Day 2: Keep it Light and Fresh

Greek yogurt is rich in calcium, a nutrient that’s vital for your baby’s developing bones and teeth.

A smoothie is an easy way to get in your greens without even tasting them. Spinach is high in folate, which is crucial for preventing neural tube defects.

Make sure to skip the raw eggs in the dressing. A protein-packed salad will keep you feeling full and satisfied.

#### Dinner: Lentil Soup with Whole Grain Bread
Lentils are an amazing source of plant-based protein and iron, which help to keep your energy levels up.

### Day 4: Filling Meals for a Busy Mom

#### Breakfast: Avocado Toast with a Poached Egg
Avocados are packed with healthy fats that are important for your baby’s brain development, and eggs provide much-needed protein.

#### Lunch: Turkey and Cheese Sandwich on Whole Grain Bread
Keep it simple with a turkey sandwich. Make sure to choose pasteurized cheese to avoid any risks.

**How many calories should I eat during the first trimester?**

Most women need around 1,800 to 2,000 calories a day during the first trimester, though this can vary depending on individual needs.
