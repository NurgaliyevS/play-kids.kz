This article explores a variety of pregnancy dinner recipes for the first trimester that are nutrient-packed, easy to make, and perfect for moms-to-be.


## Dinner Ideas First Trimester: What Should You Be Eating?

In the first trimester, your body is working overtime, developing your baby’s brain, heart, and other vital organs. So, what you eat really matters. Meals during this time should focus on getting plenty of folate, iron, calcium, and protein, while keeping things light to avoid nausea. Let's dive into some tasty and balanced options.


### 1. Quinoa Salad with Grilled Vegetables

Quinoa is a complete protein, which means it contains all the essential amino acids your body needs. Pairing it with grilled vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes adds fiber, vitamins, and minerals—perfect for a quick, satisfying meal.

### 2. Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry
