## Introduction
In the first trimester, pregnancy brings along a whirlwind of changes, cravings, and often, morning sickness. Your body starts demanding nutrients to support the growth of your little one, and what you eat becomes essential. But with exhaustion and nausea, finding dinner ideas that are easy, quick, and packed with nutrients can be a challenge.

Here’s a look into **pregnancy dinner recipes for the first trimester** that don’t compromise on flavor or nourishment. Each recipe is designed with both your health and convenience in mind, giving you the energy you need without lengthy prep times.

## Why Nutrition Matters in the First Trimester

## Key Nutrients to Focus On
Here’s a quick rundown of key nutrients that your first trimester dinners should include:

- **Folate:** Supports neural tube development. Leafy greens and lentils are rich sources.
- **Protein:** Essential for growth and cell repair. Lean meats, beans, and nuts are great choices.
