When morning sickness strikes (ironically at dinner time), and food aversions make cooking feel like climbing Mount Everest, you need realistic meal solutions. Let's dive into dinner recipes that actually work during those challenging first weeks of pregnancy.

## Early Pregnancy Food Changes

Your body's going through a whirlwind of changes, and boy, does it affect your eating habits! The first trimester brings on taste changes that can make previously loved foods seem totally unappetizing. According to [The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org), hormonal changes affect both taste buds and smell sensitivity, explaining why your favorite garlic pasta might suddenly make you queasy.

### Managing Food Aversions
- Mild, room-temperature foods
- Small, frequent portions
