## Hello, Future Mommies!

Are you excited about the little baby growing in your tummy? That's awesome! But did you know that what you eat is super important for both you and your baby? Let's talk about yummy foods that are good for you and some that you should stay away from. Don't worry, we'll make it easy to understand!

## Good Foods for You and Your Baby

When you're pregnant, your body needs extra good stuff to help your baby grow. Here are some yummy foods that are great for you:

1. Colorful Fruits and Veggies
   Imagine eating a rainbow! Fruits and veggies come in all colors, and each color gives you different healthy things. Try to eat lots of different colors every day.

2. Milk and Yogurt
   These give you calcium, which helps your baby's bones grow strong. If you don't like milk, you can try yogurt or cheese too.

3. Eggs
   Eggs are like little powerhouses of good stuff. They help your baby's brain grow smart!

4. Fish (but only some kinds)
   Fish has something called omega-3, which is super good for your baby's eyes and brain. But be careful! Some fish have too much mercury, which isn't good. Salmon and sardines are safe choices.

5. Beans and Lentils
   These are full of protein and fiber. They help you feel full and give you energy.

6. Whole Grains
   Things like brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oatmeal give you energy that lasts a long time.

7. Lean Meats
   Chicken, turkey, and lean beef have lots of protein and iron. These help your baby grow and keep your blood healthy.

## Foods to Be Careful With

Some foods can make you or your baby sick. It's best to avoid these:

1. Raw or Undercooked Meat
   This includes sushi, rare steaks, and raw eggs. They might have tiny germs that can hurt your baby.

2. Some Cheeses
   Soft cheeses like brie or blue cheese can have bad bacteria. Hard cheeses like cheddar are okay!

3. Too Much Caffeine
   A little bit of coffee or tea is okay, but not too much. Try to have less than one cup of coffee a day.

4. Alcohol
   No amount of alcohol is safe when you're pregnant. It can really hurt your baby's brain.

5. Some Fish
   Big fish like shark, swordfish, and king mackerel have too much mercury. Stick to smaller fish like salmon or tilapia.

6. Unwashed Fruits and Veggies
   Always wash your fruits and veggies really well to get rid of any dirt or germs.

## What If Food Makes You Feel Yucky?

Sometimes when you're pregnant, food can make you feel sick. This is called food aversion. Here are some tips to help:

1. Eat Small Meals
   Instead of three big meals, try eating six small meals throughout the day.

2. Drink Water
   Sipping water can help you feel better. You can also try adding a slice of lemon for flavor.

3. Try Cold Foods
   Sometimes cold foods are easier to eat than hot foods. How about a yummy fruit smoothie?

4. Ginger is Your Friend
   Ginger can help your tummy feel better. You can try ginger tea or ginger cookies.

5. Eat What You Can
   If only crackers sound good, that's okay! Eat what you can and try to add other foods slowly.

## Best Drinks When You're Pregnant

Water is the best drink for you and your baby. But if you want something different, here are some good choices:

1. Milk
   It's full of calcium and vitamin D, which are great for your baby's bones.

2. Fruit Smoothies
   Blend your favorite fruits with yogurt for a yummy and healthy drink.

3. Herbal Tea (but check with your doctor first)
   Some herbal teas are safe and can help you feel better. But always ask your doctor which ones are okay.

4. Fresh Fruit Juice
   A small glass of orange juice or apple juice can be good. But don't drink too much because it has a lot of sugar.

## What About Energy Drinks?

Energy drinks are not good when you're pregnant. They have too much caffeine and other stuff that might not be safe for your baby. If you're feeling tired, try these instead:

1. Take a short nap
2. Go for a walk in the fresh air
3. Eat a healthy snack like an apple with peanut butter
4. Drink a glass of cold water
