## The Common Battle: Nausea and Morning Sickness

You’re barely into your pregnancy and already facing one of the most infamous symptoms—**morning sickness**. But guess what? It doesn’t just come in the morning, and it can make mealtime seem daunting. Foods that would normally be your go-to comfort foods may suddenly feel intolerable. What now?

### What Causes Morning Sickness?

While the exact cause isn’t entirely clear, it’s thought to be related to the rapid rise of **hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)** and other hormonal changes. This hormonal surge impacts your digestive system, making it harder to keep food down.

When nausea takes center stage, **bland dinner ideas** can be your best bet. Here are some gentle yet satisfying dinner options:

- **Plain mashed potatoes with steamed green beans**: A comforting, easy-to-digest combo.

- **Crackers with mild cheese**: If a full meal is too much, keep it simple with a light snack-style dinner.

> **Pro Tip**: Small, frequent meals are often more manageable than three big meals when you’re feeling queasy.
