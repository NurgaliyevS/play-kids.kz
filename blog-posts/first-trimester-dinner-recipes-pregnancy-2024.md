The first trimester of pregnancy can turn your usual dinner routine upside down. With morning sickness (that often strikes at dinner time!) and changing food preferences, preparing meals becomes quite the challenge. Let's explore dinner recipes that actually work during these crucial early weeks.

## Managing Dinner Challenges During Early Pregnancy

Those first 12 weeks bring unique hurdles when it comes to evening meals. Strong food aversions might make your favorite dishes suddenly unpalatable, while nausea can peak just when you're trying to cook dinner. Research published in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* suggests hormonal fluctuations affect both smell and taste perception during early pregnancy.

### Common Food Aversions

Many pregnant women experience strong aversions to:
- Strong-smelling foods like fish or garlic
- Spicy dishes
- Heavy, greasy meals
- Red meat
- Coffee and tea
