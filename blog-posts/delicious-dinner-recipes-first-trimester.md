## What Should You Consider When Cooking During the First Trimester?

### Understanding Your Nutritional Needs

During the first trimester, your body needs extra nutrients to support the growth of your baby. But what exactly do you need? The focus should be on:

- **Folic Acid**: Crucial for fetal development, found in leafy greens, beans, and fortified cereals.
- **Iron**: Important for blood production. Incorporate red meat, poultry, fish, and spinach.
- **Calcium**: Essential for bone development. Think dairy products, almonds, and broccoli.

### Staying Hydrated

Hydration plays a key role during pregnancy. Be sure to drink plenty of water, herbal teas, or flavored water to keep your fluid intake up.
