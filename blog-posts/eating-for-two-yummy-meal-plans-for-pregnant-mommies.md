## Hello, Hungry Mommies!

Are you growing a little person in your tummy? That's so exciting! But sometimes it can be hard to know what to eat, especially if you're feeling a bit yucky. Don't worry, we're here to help! We're going to talk about yummy meals that are good for you and your baby. And the best part? They're easy to make!

## Why is Eating Well Important?

When you're pregnant, your body needs extra good stuff to help your baby grow. Eating well can:

1. Help your baby grow strong and healthy
2. Give you more energy
3. Help you feel better if you're feeling sick
4. Make it easier for your body to handle all the changes

But remember, you don't need to eat for two grown-ups! You just need a little bit extra, and it should be healthy food.

## First Trimester Yummies

The first three months of being pregnant can be tricky. You might feel sick or not want to eat much. Here are some ideas that might help:

### Breakfast Ideas:
1. Toast with peanut butter and banana slices
2. Yogurt with berries and a sprinkle of granola

## Tips for Making Meals Easier

Growing a baby is hard work! Here are some tips to make meal time easier:

1. Prep vegetables ahead of time. Wash and cut them so they're ready to use.
2. Cook extra food and save leftovers for another meal.
3. Keep healthy snacks handy for when you get hungry between meals.
4. Don't be afraid to ask for help with cooking or shopping.
5. If you're too tired to cook, it's okay to have simple meals sometimes.

## What If I Don't Feel Like Eating?

Sometimes when you're pregnant, especially in the beginning, you might not feel like eating. That's okay! Here are some things that might help:

1. Eat small meals more often instead of three big meals.
2. Try eating cold foods if hot foods make you feel sick.
3. Sip on water or ginger tea to help with nausea.
4. Plain, salty foods like crackers or pretzels might be easier to eat.
5. Eat whatever sounds good to you, even if it's not your usual food.

## Foods to Be Careful With

While most foods are safe during pregnancy, there are a few you should be careful with:

1. Raw or undercooked meat, eggs, or fish
2. Unpasteurized dairy products
3. Some kinds of fish that might have too much mercury
4. Unwashed fruits and vegetables
5. Alcohol (it's best not to drink any alcohol when you're pregnant)

Always ask your doctor if you're not sure about a food.

## Eating Well in the Second and Third Trimesters

As your baby grows, you might feel hungrier. That's normal! Here are some tips:

1. Add an extra snack or small meal to your day.
2. Choose foods high in fiber to help with constipation.
3. Eat foods rich in iron like lean meats, beans, and leafy green vegetables.
