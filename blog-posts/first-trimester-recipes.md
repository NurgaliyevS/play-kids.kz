## The Science Behind Food Aversions During Pregnancy

So, what’s really behind food aversions during pregnancy? Well, it’s largely due to hormonal shifts—mainly the rise in **hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)**. Your body reacts by making certain foods, smells, or even textures unbearable. It’s thought that food aversions, particularly to meats and strong-flavored foods, are your body’s way of protecting you and your baby from potential toxins or pathogens. So if you can’t stand the thought of chicken right now, it’s all part of your body’s natural defense system.

## How to Deal with Pregnancy Nausea and Aversions

Feeling nauseous or grossed out by food can make eating during the first trimester feel like a challenge. But you don’t have to suffer through it! Here’s how to manage:

### 1. Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals
Instead of three large meals, try having five or six smaller ones. It helps keep your blood sugar stable and minimizes nausea.

### 2. Sip on Ginger Tea
Ginger is known for its anti-nausea properties. Keep a cup of warm ginger tea handy to sip throughout the day.

### 3. Avoid Strong Smells
Smells can trigger nausea more than anything else, so stick to bland, odor-free foods like rice, crackers, and bananas.
