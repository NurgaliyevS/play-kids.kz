## Why is First Trimester Nutrition So Important?

During the initial months of pregnancy, your body lays the foundation for your baby's development. A balanced diet not only supports fetal growth but also eases some common pregnancy symptoms, like fatigue and morning sickness. Focusing on **pregnancy recipes for the first trimester** with essential nutrients ensures you get the right amount of folate, iron, calcium, and protein.

### Common Nutritional Needs for the First Trimester
- **Folate**: Key for neural tube development.
- **Iron**: Helps in forming healthy red blood cells.
- **Calcium**: Essential for developing bones and teeth.
- **Protein**: Supports cellular growth and repair.

## What to Avoid in First Trimester Meals

Not all foods are safe for early pregnancy. To protect both you and your baby, steer clear of certain ingredients.

### Foods to Avoid
- **Raw or Undercooked Meat**: Risks of bacteria and parasites.
