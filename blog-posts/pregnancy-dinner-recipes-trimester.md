We’ll explore how you can manage food cravings, ensure balanced nutrition, and make meal preparation easy even when you’re feeling tired. Let’s jump right in!

## What to Eat During the First Trimester?

The first trimester is a time when your body undergoes significant changes. It’s crucial to focus on a balanced diet that provides the essential nutrients for both you and your baby. 

During this time, you should aim to incorporate:
- **Folic acid-rich foods** such as leafy greens, oranges, and beans.
- **Calcium** from dairy, almonds, or fortified plant-based milks.
- **Iron** from lean meats, beans, and lentils.
- **Protein** from eggs, tofu, and poultry.

Balancing these nutrients is vital for your baby’s development, especially during the first 12 weeks.

## Simple and Tasty First Trimester Dinner Ideas

### 1. Light and Refreshing Stir-fry
Stir-fries are a great way to pack in vegetables and lean proteins. Add chicken or tofu, broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers, then toss everything with a little soy sauce and ginger. Serve over brown rice for a filling, nutritious dinner.

### 2. Lentil Soup with a Twist
Lentil soup is high in protein and iron—two essential nutrients for your first trimester. Add tomatoes, carrots, and celery, and season with cumin and garlic for a hearty meal. Plus, this dish is easy to make ahead and freeze for future dinners.

## Managing Food Aversions in the First Trimester

It’s no secret that the first trimester can bring about serious **pregnancy food aversions**. One day you love pasta; the next, the smell of it might make you nauseous. Here are a few tips to handle this:
- **Smaller, frequent meals**: Eating smaller portions throughout the day can help you avoid overwhelming your senses.
- **Mild flavors**: Stick to foods that are bland or mild in flavor if you’re feeling sensitive to strong smells.

### 3. Chicken and Avocado Salad
If hot meals aren’t working for you, try a cold **chicken and avocado salad**. Mix shredded chicken, creamy avocado, and a light vinaigrette for a simple and satisfying meal.

## Pregnancy Cravings: How to Handle Them
